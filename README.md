# ðŸ’¼ Salary Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses **simple linear regression** to predict an individual's salary based on their **years of experience**. It's a great starting point for understanding regression in machine learning and building your own predictive models.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Clean dataset with `YearsExperience` and `Salary` columns
- Model training using scikit-learn's Linear Regression
- Predict salary with real-time user input
- Visualize regression line vs. actual data using Matplotlib
- Evaluate model with RÂ² Score and Mean Absolute Error

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## ðŸ“ˆ How It Works

1. Load and explore the dataset
2. Train a Linear Regression model on the data
3. Accept user input (years of experience)
4. Predict and display the expected salary
5. Plot the regression line to visualize the fit

## ðŸ“Š Results

The model shows a linear relationship between experience and salary, with reasonably accurate predictions for new input values. Evaluation metrics confirm the model's effectiveness on test data.
